# OKA-Prototypes
Prototyping for OKA

Make sure you have grunt and bower installed

From the root do

$bower update
$npm install


To compile do

$grunt 


To run the livereload server do
$grunt server

This will start a server at localhost:9000, which updates when you make changes to .sass, .coffee and .html files


Work in the "app" folder.
